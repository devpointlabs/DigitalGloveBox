# Digital Glove Box

This ReadMe is here to summarize the Digital Glove Box app we've created for
DevPoint Labs. The purpose of this application is to be a one stop shop for all
of your vehicles information, a "Digital Glove Box" for you to access anytime,
anywhere. When things go wrong, we have the information that matters most (for
your car). 

Our team includes Emily Pena, Qi Cao, Thomas Gaston, and Seth Wheeler,
Full-Stack Developers looking to make the world a better place through software
development. 

NOTE: This app was created using rails for backend and react for front
end. For details on what libraries I used please check the gems file for Rails
, and package.json in the client folder for React.

## What you can expect from this app:

* A repository for your vehicle and all of their identifying information.

* The ability to add as many vehicles as you'd like.

* Easy access to your documents from a secure cloud-based database.
  Never get stuck shuffling through a dark cabinet or glovebox again (how old is
  that mint you found anyway?).

* An accessible Emergency Procedures Guide, for when life doesn't go as planned.

* COMING SOON: A monthly mailer with helpful tips to keep your car running and
  you informed of the latest news regarding your vehicles (up to date recall
  information and more)

### Some Additional Notes:

  * This file is hosted and live at https://digital-glovebox.herokuapp.com/.

  * When you clone the repo, don't forget to run bundle in the parent
    application folder, and yarn in the client folder. 

  * Create a local database and seed it to properly display items.

  * To run the app, run the rails server in http://localhost:3001/ (rails s -p
    3001), and cd into the client folder to run react in http://localhost:3000/
    (yarn start)
